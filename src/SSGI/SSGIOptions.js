/**
 * Options of the SSGI effect
 * @typedef {Object} SSGIOptions
 * @property {Number} [intensity] intensity of the ssgi
 * @property {Number} [power] the exponent by whicht the final ssgi color will be potentiated
 * @property {Number} [exponent] exponent by which ssgi will be potentiated when composing the current frame's ssgi and the accumulated ssgi into a final ssgi; higher values will make ssgi clearer by highlighting darker spots less
 * @property {Number} [distance] maximum distance a ssgi ray can travel to find what it reflects
 * @property {Number} [fade] how much ssgi will fade out by distance
 * @property {Number} [roughnessFade] how intense ssgi should be on rough spots; a higher value will make ssgi fade out quicker on rough spots
 * @property {Number} [thickness] maximum depth difference between a ray and the particular depth at its screen position before refining with binary search; higher values will result in better performance
 * @property {Number} [ior] Index of Refraction, used for calculating fresnel; reflections tend to be more intense the steeper the angle between them and the viewer is, the ior parameter sets how much the intensity varies
 * @property {Number} [diffuseIntensity] how much the diffuse texture of a material influences SSGI
 * @property {Number} [mip] The maximum mip map level to use. A value of 0 will make SSGI always use the original input texture. A value of 1 will make SSGI use all mipmaps from the highest to the lowest possible.
 * @property {Number} [maxRoughness] maximum roughness a texel can have to have ssgi calculated for it
 * @property {Number} [maxDepthDifference] maximum depth difference between a ray and the particular depth at its screen position after refining with binary search; higher values will result in better performance
 * @property {Number} [blend] a value between 0 and 1 to set how much the last frame's ssgi should be blended in; higher values will result in less noisy ssgi when moving the camera but a more smeary look
 * @property {boolean} [correction] how much pixels should be corrected when doing temporal resolving; higher values will result in less smearing but more noise
 * @property {boolean} [correctionRadius] how many surrounding pixels will be used for neighborhood clamping; a higher value can reduce noise when moving the camera but will result in less performance
 * @property {Number} [blur] how much the blurred ssgi should be mixed with the raw ssgi
 * @property {Number} [jitter] how intense jittering should be
 * @property {Number} [jitterRoughness] how intense jittering should be in relation to a material's roughness
 * @property {Number} [steps] number of steps a ssgi ray can maximally do to find an object it intersected (and thus reflects)
 * @property {Number} [refineSteps] once we had our ray intersect something, we need to find the exact point in space it intersected and thus it reflects; this can be done through binary search with the given number of maximum steps
 * @property {Number} [steps] number of samples per pixel
 * @property {boolean} [missedRays] if there should still be ssgi for rays for which a reflecting point couldn't be found; enabling this will result in stretched looking ssgi which can look good or bad depending on the angle
 * @property {boolean} [useNormalMap] if roughness maps should be taken account of when calculating ssgi
 * @property {boolean} [useRoughnessMap] if normal maps should be taken account of when calculating ssgi
 * @property {Number} [resolutionScale] resolution of the SSGI effect, a resolution of 0.5 means the effect will be rendered at half resolution
 * @property {Number} [qualityScale] resolution of the velocity buffer, a resolution of 0.5 means velocity will be rendered at half resolution
